# UltraDNS SDK

This SDK implements a subset of the UltraDNS functionality. It does not attempt to implement a client for all available UltraDNS REST API functionality.
Adding additional functionality should be relatively straightforward, and any contributions from the UltraDNS community would be greatly appreciated.
